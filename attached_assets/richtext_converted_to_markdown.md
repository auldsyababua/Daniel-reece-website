**TESTIMONIALS**

Daniel took the time to get to know me and my inhibitions and fears for standing in front of a large audience. He empowered me with tools to not just deliver a speech but more importantly connect with my audience and involve them in what I had to say. I learned techniques and how to be consciously present in that moment and not just try to get it over and done with. I have done speaking engagements before, but none like this one.. and you could tell I connected with my audience from the standing ovation I got at the end of it all. Thank you Daniel … I will always remember this moment as one of the most gratifying and surreal experiences in my life.

My experience with Daniel as a speech coach has been nothing short of transformative. From day one, he attentively listened to my concerns and tailored our sessions to address my unique challenges. Daniel's holistic approach helped me improve my speech and taught me to be a better communicator by tapping into my authentic self and engaging more genuinely with my audience. His guidance on the importance of inside-out communication, attention to thought groups, pacing, and emphasis has proved invaluable to my overall ability to deliver powerful messages. Furthermore, Daniel's warm, encouraging demeanor and non-judgmental coaching style instilled in me the confidence to take risks with my voice and empowered me to grow professionally and personally. I highly recommend Daniel as a speech coach for anyone seeking to elevate their communication skills and make a lasting impact on their audience.

From day one, Daniel was able to understand the workflow of a technical person dealing with multiple audiences and break that down into speech techniques. Daniel was able to teach some quick methods for dealing with a multitude of situations, how to keep an audience when talking about complex topics, and how to dial in the level of detail. I'd highly recommend Daniel as his style of coaching is very tailored to the individual, and his demeanor is very friendly and a joy to work with.

When I started this journey, I was highly anxious about public speaking and speaking on camera. Daniel has offered me tools that have eased my anxiety significantly. I'm excited to see what else we can achieve on this journey.

Daniel is an enthusiastic coach that brings a lot of attention, experience and knowledge into each of our private sessions. Going into our lessons my goal was to gain confidence and tools I need to bring out my natural voice and ability to communicate and found lessons with Daniel incredibly helpful! I especially appreciate Daniel's philosophy to bring out and celebrate our individuality instead of fitting us into preconceived and conventional molds. I highly recommend Daniel to all who wish to hone their public speaking / communications skills.
