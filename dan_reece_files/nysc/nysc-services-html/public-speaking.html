    <div class="services-detail-content"><div><h1 dir="ltr"><b>Improving Public Speaking Techniques and Skills</b></h1><p dir="ltr">The lights are bright, the stage is hot ... imagine stepping to the podium in front of a group of strangers, colleagues, and peers and feeling nothing but confidence in your ability to communicate your message. In the professional world and beyond, public speaking skills are among the most sought after, yet many people feel held back by anxiety, poor articulation, or a general feeling of “I’m not a natural at this.” Fortunately, there exist numerous tools to sharpen your public speaking technique and become a poised, articulate, and confident presenter ready to handle even the most intimidating scenarios and unexpected questions.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Why is public speaking so frightening?</b></h2><p dir="ltr">What is it about speaking in front of an audience that gives the majority of people serious qualms? This haunting stage fright - which prevents many of us from speaking at professional and social events - stems from a variety of reasons:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><b>Biology</b>: Being put on the spot often activates our body’s sympathetic nervous system (aka stress mode), giving us a racing heart, sweaty palms, and a shaky voice. A person’s baseline level of public speaking anxiety correlates with their genetic predisposition, as well as past traumatic experiences.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Lack of experience</b>: If speaking in front of a crowd is only done twice per year, you can imagine it will be more difficult than if you’re leading the meeting every week. Repeated positive experiences allow us to feel more comfortable and confident when delivering presentations.&nbsp;</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Fear of being judged</b>: Presenting in front of a group of people — no matter how large — causes many speakers to feel concerned about not meeting expectations and being judged by their audience.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Imposter syndrome</b>: Many people battle subconscious fears that they are not truly up for the task at hand. Public speaking can exacerbate imposter syndrome, making a speaker fearful that the stage will shine a spotlight on any incompetencies.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Anxiety about making a mistake</b>: From stumbling over words to giving an incorrect statistic, it's normal to worry about the multitude of things that could go wrong during a presentation.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Fear of looking unprepared</b>: Most presentations include time for questions and answers. This can be nerve-wracking as speakers don't know exactly what to expect from their audience and may fear being put on the spot.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Discomfort with your voice and body</b>: Preparing to speak in front of an audience can feel physically uncomfortable. Many speakers worry about looking natural and properly managing body language such as hand gestures, posture, eye contact, and breathing.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><b>America's Greatest Fear Needn't Be Yours</b></h2><p dir="ltr">If you’ve ever watched TED Talks and thought, “are they just naturals at this?” you’re not alone. The truth is, many of the speakers you most admire have decades of speech training under their belts.</p><p dir="ltr">Our public speaking training guides you through the steps to present the best version of yourself. We discuss how to project relaxed enthusiasm, pleasant assertiveness, and grounded vitality. We'll cover topics ranging from body work (“What do I do with my hands?!” ”Should I walk around?”) to voice control (“What do I do when my voice starts to quiver?” “How can I project without yelling?”) to handling anxiety (“My mind goes blank when I get nervous!” “How can I stop my heart from racing?”) to impromptu speaking (“I’m fine when I know my content in advance, but I hate being put on the spot!”). Public speaking is a wonderful discipline that's surprisingly underserved, and once we work on some fundamental principles together, you'll find that you are able to see exciting results — even after your first lesson.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Can I get over my anxiety and feel more confident?</b></h2><p dir="ltr">Confidence is absolutely something that can be learned, as opposed to something that exclusively occurs naturally. We will provide you with a set of experiences and techniques to improve your confidence dramatically. This is accomplished through a commitment-oriented philosophy by way of learning the best ways to prepare, achieve a healthy perspective, and master physicalities that support and convey confidence.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Creating Practical Skills for Speaking in Public</b></h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, finding ways to improve your public speaking abilities doesn't have to be daunting. Becoming a powerful public speaker requires mastering a specific set of skills, which you can sharpen through time, effort, feedback, and plenty of practice. Developing these public speaking abilities will put you on the path to a successful speech:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><b>Authenticity</b>: An audience can sense when you're being yourself. Most importantly, speaking authentically will help you to feel calm and confident throughout your presentation. Instead of "faking it until you make it," speak honestly and use language that reflects who you are and what you know.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Confidence</b>: Confidence is key to appearing credible, knowledgeable, and accurate. Being truly confident in front of a crowd is not easy — but it is achievable, and one of the most important practical skills for speaking in public.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Articulation</b>: The best public speakers are easy to understand. Excellent articulation includes an entire set of skills, from enunciating clearly and speaking loudly to eliminating the use of filler words and using proper grammar.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Engagement</b>: Strong public speakers can engage their audience and keep them interested, no matter the topic. Becoming a commanding presence might come more naturally to some individuals than others, but at its core, it is a learned skill that anybody can master. A skilled presentation style includes developing a varied vocal tone, engaging facial expressions, and using appropriate timing.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Interaction</b>: It takes time and practice to learn how to properly interact with your audience — but it's one of the most important ways to communicate your message. Between asking good questions, requesting volunteers, and using strong eye contact, the best presentations are two-way dialogues.</li><li dir="ltr"><b>Personability</b>: Do you want to learn how to grow as a speaker? Connecting with your audience is crucial. Developing personable skills — such as the ability to tell engaging stories and adapt your presentation style to fit your audience — will take you far in your journey to becoming an outstanding public speaker.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><b>What do we work on in a Public Speaking session?</b></h2><p dir="ltr">Public speaking lessons can cover speaking voice enhancement, body language &amp; gesture work, preparation technique, reducing anxiety, mastering verbatim / extemporaneous / impromptu speaking, microphone &amp; podium comfort, media training, and much more. We are able to train you in the skills required to be an effective, dynamic communicator when in front of a group.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>We'll Work on Your Speeches and Presentations&nbsp;</b></h2><p dir="ltr">If you are preparing for a big speech or presentation and would like to practice and get some ideas, this is a great place to do it. We believe in crafting a positive, creative, and professional environment where you can receive honest and effective feedback about your public speaking. Our studio is equipped with a lectern and a microphone, as well as sound and camera equipment, for occasions when it's appropriate to record your work.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest mistakes people make with public speaking is ineffective preparation. Many times speakers will envision what they want to do with their speeches and then will find the circumstance of that speech jarringly different than their expectations. As a result, their performance - and sometimes career - can suffer.</p><p dir="ltr">We will teach you effective methods to prepare and practice for your speeches. Having a game plan and a tangible technique to know you are ready for your speech can make an enormous difference in your confidence and performance.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Private Lessons</b></h2><p dir="ltr">If the idea of presenting in front of a group seems intimidating, our private lessons are the perfect solution. At New York Speech Coaching, we frame our private training around your personal values and goals. After determining what is standing in the way of your effective presentation, we'll tailor a syllabus that includes conditioning exercises with expert feedback to help you achieve your goals.</p><p dir="ltr">Our private lesson format offers a variety of standout benefits that many clients appreciate, including:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Creating a comfortable and supportive one-on-one environment</li><li dir="ltr">Reducing the intimidation factor for any individuals anxious about public speaking</li><li dir="ltr">Helping clients gain the confidence needed to showcase new skills at a comfortable pace</li><li dir="ltr">Providing an opportunity for personalized feedback focused on specific areas of strength and weakness</li><li dir="ltr">Allowing for custom lesson plans built around specific objectives</li><li dir="ltr">Offering a flexible schedule structure that's perfect for time-strapped professionals</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><b>How does private instruction differ from the public speaking courses at my office?</b></h2><p dir="ltr">At New York Speech Coaching, we offer both private instruction and <a href="https://presentingsolutions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate training</a>. Perhaps you have had a public speaking seminar in the past and found it helpful, but often people require one-on-one attention to feel confident in their presentations and speeches. We blend healthy vocal production with the fundamentals of public speaking, as well as concepts from theatre and improv to discover your authentic professional voice. Other public speaking courses commonly focus on organizing your content and PowerPoint. While we can help with this, our work is not primarily about content, but delivery.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>What about one-on-one or informal situations?</b></h2><p dir="ltr">“Public speaking skills” are not limited to presentations in front of auditoriums and board rooms. Working on the fundamentals of public speaking can help you to alleviate social anxiety and feel more comfortable conversationally, at parties, or meeting new people. The techniques can be applied to a one-on-one meeting with a client just as easily as for a big speech!</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Group Sessions</b></h2><p dir="ltr">While private lessons provide many benefits for individuals looking to grow their confidence and develop essential public speaking skills, group sessions offer an alternative option and a host of other advantages. Learning alongside a group of other course participants can help you strengthen your skills in several ways. You will:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Gain confidence within a supportive group of peers who share similar goals.</li><li dir="ltr">Learn through observation and direct peer feedback.</li><li dir="ltr">Share valuable feedback with your peers and instructors.</li><li dir="ltr">Network and build relationships with peers and colleagues.</li><li dir="ltr">Become more comfortable presenting in front of a group.</li><li dir="ltr">Improve your communication and listening skills.</li><li dir="ltr">Inspire others and be inspired in return.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Seminars, Workshops, and Group Training</b></h2><p dir="ltr">At New York Speech Coaching, we offer a range of seminars, workshops, and group training opportunities designed to fit your corporate or personal goals. Our seminars are geared toward educating and informing aspiring public speakers, while our workshops are a chance to practically apply what you are learning. During group training sessions, attendees can strengthen their presentation skills alongside peers to grow and learn together.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're an executive looking to improve your team's public speaking capabilities, we can customize our seminars, workshops, and group training options to fit your exact needs.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Why should my group take a public speaking course?</b></h2><p dir="ltr">If you are preparing for a big speech or presentation and would like to practice and get some ideas, this is a great place to do it. We believe in crafting a positive, creative, and professional environment where you can get honest and effective feedback about your public speaking. Our studio is equipped with a lectern and a microphone, as well as sound and camera equipment, for occasions when it's appropriate to record your work.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest mistakes people make with public speaking is ineffective preparation. Many times speakers will envision what they want to do with their speeches and then will find the circumstance of that speech jarringly different than their expectations. As a result, their performance - and sometimes career - can suffer.</p><p dir="ltr">We will teach you effective methods to prepare and practice for your speeches. Having a game plan and a tangible technique to know you are ready for your speech can make an enormous difference in your confidence and performance.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Public Speaking for the Corporate and Business World</b></h2><h3 dir="ltr"><b>Bring yourself to the business world.</b></h3><p dir="ltr">A great deal of professional success rests on one’s ability to express oneself. Sometimes what is lost in speech programs is the ability to find one’s own voice. People may be “well-spoken” and “professional,” yet still struggle to find that extra spark that makes them truly dynamic speakers. Bringing your own personality into your corporate presence is among our top priorities. We balance that with areas that may need attention to help you develop a public presence that is authoritative, credible, vibrant, friendly, confident, approachable, and trustworthy.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><b>We Can Travel to Your Corporate Office</b></h3><p dir="ltr">Most people prefer to work on their public speaking at our studio in Midtown Manhattan. It is a wonderful environment for building confidence in your corporate presence. However, we absolutely travel to offices to train speakers. If you would prefer that we travel to your office, please contact us to discuss the details.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><b>Internationally Renowned Speech Coaches and Experts</b></h2><p dir="ltr">New York Speech Coaching is comprised of a team of coaches and speech experts with a reputation that spans the globe. Our specialty areas include helping clients overcome their public speaking fears, improve their presentation skills, develop authentic confidence, and communicate their ideas effectively in a public setting.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to transforming your speech and enhancing your voice, we provide expert assistance. Our team will serve as your public speaking guide to help you claim the presentation skills you need through individualized one-on-one or group sessions.</p><p><a href="https://newyorkspeechcoaching.com/contact">Contact New York Speech Coaching today</a> to get started and book your first appointment.
