### **15  Keyword Targets**

**High‑Value / High‑Competition**

| Keyword | Intent | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| speech coach NYC | Commercial (local) | Core money term—highest competition |
| public speaking coach NYC | Commercial (local) | Strong lead driver; optimize service page \+ GBP |
| public speaking classes NYC | Transactional (local) | Compete with class‑based rivals; needs dedicated class page |
| accent reduction NYC | Commercial (local) | High CPC; leverage accent service page \+ testimonials |
| executive communication coach | Commercial (national) | Targets corporate budgets; case‑study content helpful |
| online speech coach | Commercial (national) | Capture remote prospects; optimize new "Online Coaching" page |
| voice coach New York | Informational/Commercial | Overlaps with vocal coaching sites—needs semantic coverage |

**Low‑Hanging‑Fruit (Opportunity Gaps)**

| Keyword | Estimated Diff. | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| impromptu speaking coach | Low | Few optimized pages; create tip blog \+ service subsection |
| speech anxiety coaching | Low | Competitors ignore mental aspect; publish guide & FAQ |
| storytelling coach for executives | Medium | Align with data‑storytelling offering; long‑form pillar post |
| data storytelling training NYC | Medium | Combine analytics \+ speaking niche; target B2B teams |
| corporate presentation skills workshop | Low | Service page & LinkedIn articles can rank quickly |
| remote accent reduction sessions | Low | Long‑tail remote query—optimized for international leads |
| stage presence coaching for professionals | Medium | Differentiate from acting schools; case‑study content |
| zoom presentation coach | Low | Pandemic‑driven term; competitors have thin content |

*Approach:* Prioritize publishing pillar pages for high‑competition terms while scheduling 2–3 blog posts per month targeting the low‑hanging‑fruit list to capture quick wins and build topical authority.

### 16  Content Pillars  ​​To create a pillar content strategy for the website and its listed services, we’ll structure the content into core pillar pages (broad, high-level content that targets main topics) and cluster content pages (more focused subtopics or service-specific pages that link back to the pillars). This structure is essential for both user navigation and SEO, particularly for ranking in Google’s semantic search environment.
