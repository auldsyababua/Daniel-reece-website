## Command Any Room with Your Voice

Your voice is your most powerful leadership tool. Yet many executives struggle with weak projection, vocal fatigue, or a voice that doesn't match their authority. Using proven techniques from theater and vocal science, I help leaders develop voices that command attention, convey confidence, and create lasting impact.

### The Hidden Power of Voice Projection

Research shows that 38% of communication impact comes from vocal qualities. A well-projected voice:

- Commands immediate attention and respect
- Reduces the need to repeat yourself
- Prevents vocal strain during long speaking days
- Projects confidence even when you don't feel it
- Creates presence in both small meetings and large venues

### Understanding Voice Projection

True projection isn't about being loudâ€”it's about vocal efficiency and resonance. Many people damage their voices trying to be heard, when the solution lies in proper technique.
