## Conquer Your Public Speaking Anxiety

Public speaking anxiety affects 75% of the population, making it one of the most common fears. But here's what I know after coaching hundreds of executives: this fear is not only manageable—it can be transformed into one of your greatest strengths. Using techniques refined through years of theatrical training and executive coaching, I help professionals turn speaking anxiety into speaking excellence.

### Understanding Public Speaking Anxiety

Public speaking anxiety manifests differently for everyone. You might experience:

- Racing heartbeat before presentations
- Sweaty palms and trembling hands
- Mind going blank mid-sentence
- Avoiding speaking opportunities that could advance your career
- Overthinking every word days before a presentation
- Physical tension that affects your voice and presence

These symptoms are your body's natural fight-or-flight response. The key isn't to eliminate these feelings—it's to channel them into dynamic, engaging presentations.

### The Theater-Based Approach That Works

My unique approach combines proven anxiety management techniques with performance methods used by professional actors. This isn't about pretending or putting on a mask—it's about finding your authentic voice even when anxiety strikes.
